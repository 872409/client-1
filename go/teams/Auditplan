What happens if member is added while audit happens or some s8rs thing like that?
So may always need to do retry even if OK server...

Also CLI options to trigger box audits... how does that interact withs chedule? Maybe no scheduling.
Make sure works fine if manually triggered several times

env var to disable too

NEEED WAY MORE LOGGING!

What happens if the db is corrupted/ force killed or something
featureflag?

Maybe ServerMal functions have a special suffix
or opposite (Suspicious? or different err type...:()

It's ok if there's no box audit summary because we can just rotate and then there will be one ETC.

handle boxAuditError in gui
Tests
CMD
I wonder if we need some way for TeamBoxAudit to return a nonfatal error if retryable...

// TODO put in ftl
// TODO make sure it still works if we're in jail. we need
// some logic that filters jailed bros out of the random selection BUT
// still allows it when manually auditing

what if we keep trying to load a team we can't audit because subteam reader...
fml
cant happen because load1 is always explicit. ;;
