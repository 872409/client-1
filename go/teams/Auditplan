What happens if the db is corrupted/ force killed or something



LOWPRI
I wonder if we need some way for TeamBoxAudit to return a nonfatal error if retryable...
featureflag? - don't release

------------------

Maybe ServerMal functions have a special suffix
or opposite (Suspicious? or different err type...:()

// TODO make sure it still works if we're in jail. we need
// some logic that filters jailed bros out of the random selection BUT
// still allows it when manually auditing
or maybe not

GET RID OF HASH IN ENDPOINT

It's ok if there's no box audit summary because we can just rotate and then there will be one ETC.
    NOT TRUe, need to to REHEJ as well
TODO ROLLOUT! PEOPLE HAVE IN CACHE BUT NO BOXSUMMARHASHES...
TODO when to change BSh to Require?

put the permanent in noclean

rename AssertOK to AssertUnjailedOrReaudit

a ton of BOXAUD stuff ons tartup..investigate
(it was probably jail check)...
