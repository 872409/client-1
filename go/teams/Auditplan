Also CLI options to trigger box audits... how does that interact withs chedule? Maybe no scheduling.
Make sure works fine if manually triggered several times

NEEED WAY MORE LOGGING!

What happens if the db is corrupted/ force killed or something
featureflag?

Maybe ServerMal functions have a special suffix
or opposite (Suspicious? or different err type...:()

It's ok if there's no box audit summary because we can just rotate and then there will be one ETC.
TODO stop hard requiring audit summaries in chain loader... just optionalok?

handle boxAuditError in gui
Tests
CMD work
I wonder if we need some way for TeamBoxAudit to return a nonfatal error if retryable...

// TODO make sure it still works if we're in jail. we need
// some logic that filters jailed bros out of the random selection BUT
// still allows it when manually auditing
or maybe not

provide rotate before audit fn?

GET RID OF HASH IN ENDPOINT

TODO ROLLOUT! PEOPLE HAVE IN CACHE BUT NO BOXSUMMARHASHES...

put the permanent in noclean
