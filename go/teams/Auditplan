handle boxAuditError in gui - check if it even works
Tests
NEEED WAY MORE LOGGING!
What happens if the db is corrupted/ force killed or something
clean up box_audit.go
It's ok if there's no box audit summary because we can just rotate and then there will be one ETC. NOT TRUe, need to to REHEJ as well TODO ROLLOUT! PEOPLE HAVE IN CACHE BUT NO BOXSUMMARHASHES...  TODO when to change BSh to Require?
put the permanent in noclean

LOWPRI
I wonder if we need some way for TeamBoxAudit to return a nonfatal error if retryable...or just some keybase1Audit{} that embds an Attempt
featureflag? - don't release
Maybe ServerMal functions have a special suffix or opposite (Suspicious? or different err type...:()
